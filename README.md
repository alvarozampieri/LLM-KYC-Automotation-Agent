# LLM Vertical Agent for KYC Process Automation

Welcome to the **LLM Vertical Agent for KYC Automation** project! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the **Know Your Customer (KYC)** process using a specialized **Language Learning Model (LLM) Vertical Agent**. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and AI, this tool will streamline the traditionally manual and time-consuming KYC procedures for businesses, financial institutions, and fintech companies.

## Features

- **Automated Document Parsing**: The agent automatically extracts and verifies key data from various KYC documents (e.g., passports, IDs, proof of address).
- **Real-time Verification**: Instant cross-referencing with databases for validating customer identity.
- **Fraud Detection**: LLM-based detection of discrepancies and potential red flags in documents and customer-provided information.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures that the KYC process adheres to the necessary regional regulations (e.g., AML laws).
- **Customizable**: Tailored to specific business requirements or compliance needs, particularly within the fintech vertical.
  
## How It Works

1. **Input**: Customers upload their KYC documents (e.g., government-issued IDs, utility bills).
2. **Processing**: The LLM Agent reads, parses, and analyzes the documents, extracting key information (e.g., name, date of birth, address).
3. **Verification**: It verifies the extracted data against known databases and flags any inconsistencies or suspicious activity.
4. **Output**: Provides a report highlighting whether the customer has passed KYC checks or if further manual review is needed.

## Tech Stack

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: LLM-based technology such as OpenAIâ€™s GPT or fine-tuned transformers.
- **Document Parsing**: Tools like AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision, or custom OCR solutions.
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, or FastAPI for API creation.
- **Frontend**: Basic interface using React or Vue.js (optional).
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS or GCP for hosting and scaling the KYC process.
- **Databases**: Integration with KYC and AML databases (e.g., World-Check, LexisNexis).
